# Flappy Bird with AI: A Neural Network Approach

Recreation of flappy bird game with an AI component that uses a neural network to learn how to play the game by itself. Over time, the AI improves its performance through training and learns to navigate the bird more effectively.

## Technoliges Used
Python: The primary programming language used for this project.
Pygame: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
Neural Networks: Implemented using basic Python to train the AI.
