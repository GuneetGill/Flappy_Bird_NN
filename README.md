# Flappy Bird with AI: A Neural Network Approach

Recreation of the Flappy Bird game with an AI component that uses a neural network to learn how to play the game by itself. Over time, the AI improves its performance through training and learns to navigate the bird more effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Pygame**: A set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
- **Neural Networks**: Implemented using basic Python to train the AI.

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy**: Used for performing various calculations, matrix operations, vectorized computations, random number generation, and statistical analysis for evaluating neural network performance.
